# EWS Migration Tools

## Overview

Exchange Web Services (EWS) is a SOAP-based API that is used to access Exchange Online and Exchange Server. Microsoft has announced the deprecation of EWS for Exchange Online in favor of Microsoft Graph API, which provides access to many Microsoft 365 workloads including Exchange Online.

This repo contains tools to help you identify apps within your tenant that are using EWS and help you migrate them to Microsoft Graph API.

## EWS Usage Reporting

M365 provides [reports of EWS usage](https://admin.cloud.microsoft/?#/reportsUsage/EWSWeeklyUsage) in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This your first port of call to identify apps using EWS. The reports are available in the Microsoft 365 admin center under Reports > Usage > Exchange Web Services (EWS) Weekly Usage for tenants in the worldwide cloud.

If your tenant is in an isolated cloud (e.g. government or sovereign cloud), these reports are not available in the admin center at this time.

The tools in this repo can be used to identify EWS usage in all clouds with access to the Microsoft Graph AuditLog API.

The EWS Usage Reporting tools are located in folder `/src/Ews.AppUsage` and build on [Jim Martin](https://github.com/jmartinmsft)'s excellent and versatile scripts for detecting EWS usage in Exchange Online at [Exchange App Usage Reporting](https://github.com/jmartinmsft/Exchange-App-Usage-Reporting).

See the [EWS App Usage Reporting Readme](src/Ews.App.Usage/README.md) for more information on how to set up and run the tools.

## EWS Code Analyzer

Once you have identified applications in your tenant using EWS, you can use the EWS Code Analyzer to identify all EWS references in your code and get suggestions for migration to equivalent Microsoft Graph APIs from related documentation and GitHub Copilot.

The code analyzer is a Roslyn analyzer that can be used in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. At this time it supports any EWS application built using .NET SDKs for EWS.

The EWS Code Analyzer is located in folder `/src/Ews.CodeAnalyzer`.

See the [EWS Code Analyzer Readme](src/Ews.Code.Analyzer/README.md) for more information on how to set up and run the tools.

## MCP Server (GitHub Copilot Integration)

An experimental Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is included to allow GitHub Copilot (and other MCP-aware clients) to:

- Analyze snippets / files / directories for EWS usage
- List EWS SDK invocation sites with Graph migration metadata
- Retrieve migration roadmap entries (also exposed as MCP resources)
- Generate a tailored prompt to convert one EWS usage to Microsoft Graph (also via MCP prompts)
- Stream partial progress notifications (when verbose logging enabled)

Location: `src/Ews.Code.Analyzer/Ews.Analyzer.McpService`

### Running Locally

1. Restore & build:
	 ```bash
	 dotnet build src/Ews.Code.Analyzer/Ews.Analyzer.McpService/Ews.Analyzer.McpService.csproj
	 ```
2. (Optional) Run standalone and send JSON-RPC lines:
	 ```bash
	 dotnet run --project src/Ews.Code.Analyzer/Ews.Analyzer.McpService/Ews.Analyzer.McpService.csproj
	 ```

### Sample `mcp.json`

Place this in your Copilot client configuration (or use the provided `mcp.sample.json`).

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"ews-analyzer": {
			"command": "dotnet",
			"args": ["run", "--project", "src/Ews.Code.Analyzer/Ews.Analyzer.McpService/Ews.Analyzer.McpService.csproj"],
			"alwaysAllow": true
		}
	}
}
```

### Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| analyzeSnippet | Analyze inline C# code |
| analyzeFile | Analyze a file path (within repo allowlist) |
| analyzeProject | Analyze all `*.cs` files under a root (capped) |
| listEwsUsages | Return just EWS usages with Graph metadata |
| getRoadmap | Get roadmap by SOAP op or SDK qualified name |
| generateGraphPrompt | Produce migration prompt for Copilot |
| setLogging | Toggle verbose notifications |

### Resources & Prompts

MCP Resources (URI pattern `roadmap/<EwsSoapOperation>`) expose individual roadmap entries.

MCP Prompts:

| Prompt | Description | Required Args |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| migrate-ews-usage | Migration guidance for a single usage | sdkQualifiedName |
| summarize-project-ews | High-level summary request (client should call analyzeProject first) | rootPath |

### Security / Limits

- File & project tools are restricted to the current working directory tree.
- Max project files scanned defaults to 500 (override with `maxFiles`).
- Basic in-memory hashing cache avoids re-analyzing unchanged code.

### Roadmap

Future improvements may include: MSBuild-based full project loading, code fix diffs (patch suggestions), richer caching, cancellation, and telemetry opt-in.
